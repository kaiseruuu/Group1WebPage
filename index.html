    <h1>Science</h1>
    <p>
      The term "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia," which means
      knowledge founded on demonstrable and reproducible data. Science is the
      systematic pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the
      natural and social worlds. Science is divided into three branches:
      physical science (physics and chemistry), life science (biology, ecology,
      and environmental science), and Earth Science (geology, meteorology,
      astronomy, and oceanography).

    <h2>Physical Science</h2>
    <p>
      Physical science is the study of various steps related to the inorganic
      world, as opposed to organic world study, which is the main branch of
      biological science. Physics, chemistry, earth science, geology, space
      science, astronomy, materials science, and other disciplines are covered.
      In contrast to life science, physical science is an important component of
      natural science that deals with the study of non-living processes/systems.

    <h2>Life Science</h2>
    <p>
      Life science is one of the branches of science that study living things.
      The life sciences are scientific fields that study living organisms such
      as plants, animals, and humans. Life sciences investigate the biology of
      how these organisms live, which is why this group of specialties is
      sometimes referred to as biology.

    <h2>Earth Science</h2>
    <p>
      The term "earth science" is commonly used to refer to the study of the
      earth's atmosphere (meteorology or atmospheric science), the water flowing
      on and beneath the surface of continents (hydrology), and the earth's seas
      and oceans (oceanography or ocean sciences). Earth science is the study of
      the Earth's structure, properties, processes, and the planets that orbit
      it. This branch of science studies the Earth's structure, processes, and
      properties.
